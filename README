# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Detecting emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, calm and neutral using paralinguistic aspects of speech.

Paralinguistic acoustic features include features such as frequency, loudness, spectral centroids, LFCCs, MFCCs, etc. These are extracted from the speech
dataset 'RAVDESS' and included with the repo as 'features_652.json'. Number of features is 652.

Run 'selection.py' to select the top 177 features and store it in 'X_diff.npy'.

Each of the 5 classifiers makes use of 'features_652.json' and 'X_diff.npy' to detect emotion from speech. Each of them use K-fold cross-validation to report 
performance metrics with K = 10.
